## Introduction, data visualisation and position indexes

Exercise 1.

An airline specialised in long distance flights took data on the passengers that booked a flight on the previous day. The variables they have at disposal are:

1.  $G$: gender
2.  $X$: highest degree attained
3.  $Z$: reason for traveling
4.  $Y$: number of flights bought with that company
5.  $W$: price of latest flight bought with that company


The raw data is presented in the following table:

```{r xtable,echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
        id= 1:3,
        G= c("F","M", "F"),
        X= c("High school","Bachelor",  "Master"),
        Z= c("Leisure","Work", "Leisure"),
        Y= c(1, 3, 1),
        W= c(343.9, 615, 808))

df
```
